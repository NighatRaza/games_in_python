# number_guessing_game_in_python

This game includes a library called "random" to generate random numbers each time.
User has to choose a number, if the random number and user's input gets equal, then the user wins.
Made a simple game with the help of loops, conditional statements and comparison operators.
Hope you enjoy it!
